# Spotter

Save a fitness video from TikTok, Instagram or YouTube. Spotter reads the exercises, sets
and reps out of the caption, gives you a real workout card, then walks you through it one
move at a time and logs what you lifted.

**Live app:** https://simeonrinkenberger.github.io/spotter/

## What it does

- **Save** — paste a link, or share to it from your phone with a one-step iOS Shortcut.
- **Extract** — the caption or description becomes a structured card: title, workout type,
  muscle groups, equipment, difficulty, duration, and exercise blocks with sets, reps,
  rest and circuit rounds.
- **Train** — full-screen Workout Mode, one exercise per screen, screen kept awake, with
  set-by-set logging of reps and weight (prefilled from the last time you did that move).
- **Plan** — drop saved workouts onto a week and see which days you actually trained.
- **Track** — weekly volume, per-exercise personal records (estimated 1RM), muscle-group
  balance, and a session history.

## Architecture

Two moving parts, no build step and no bundler.

```
Browser (GitHub Pages, docs/index.html)
  ├── supabase-js ──► PostgREST      reads + simple writes, protected by per-user RLS
  └── fetch ────────► Edge Function  ingest, re-extract, AI helpers (needs secrets)
                        └──► Instagram / TikTok / YouTube, then Gemini → Groq
```

The frontend talks to the database directly under row-level security, so the edge function
only holds what genuinely needs a service role or an API key. Every user-owned table has a
`user_id` and owner-only policies; `video_cache` and `saves_log` have RLS on with **zero**
policies, making them reachable only from the function.

**Shared extraction cache.** Extractions are cached globally by video ID. The first person
to save a video pays for the scrape and the AI call; everyone after that gets the same card
instantly and for free. This is the main thing that makes a public app affordable on free
tiers.

**Controlled exercise names.** The model proposes a free-form exercise name; `catalog.ts`
maps it to a stable `canonical_exercise_id` from a seeded catalog (exact match, then alias,
then weighted token overlap above a confidence floor — no AI). The raw name is kept and
shown; the id is what the weight prefill and personal records group by, so "DB Bulgarians"
and "Bulgarian Split Squats" are one exercise rather than two. A name that does not clear
the floor gets a null id rather than a wrong one.

**No fetching private addresses.** Every outbound request derived from a user link goes
through `net.ts`, which rejects loopback, link-local, RFC1918 and literal-IP hosts and
re-checks after **every** redirect hop.

### Source layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `supabase/functions/spotter/index.ts` | The whole backend: URL parsing, scrapers, AI chain, extraction, routes |
| `supabase/functions/spotter/catalog.ts` | Canonical exercise catalog + the name normalizer (source of truth) |
| `supabase/functions/spotter/net.ts` | Outbound request guard: private-address filter, per-hop redirect checks |
| `supabase/functions/spotter/style.ts` | Design tokens and every component style |
| `supabase/functions/spotter/markup.ts` | Page head, landing page, app shell, sheets |
| `supabase/functions/spotter/app.ts` | All app logic: auth, library, Workout Mode, plan, progress |
| `supabase/functions/spotter/page.ts` | Stitches the three together for the function |
| `build.mjs` | Same stitch, writing `docs/index.html` for GitHub Pages |
| `supabase/migrations/` | Schema, RLS policies, profile trigger, storage bucket, exercise catalog |
| `tools/` | Catalog migration generator, normalizer test battery, one-time backfill |

The three frontend modules are `String.raw` templates, so they must never contain a
backtick or `${`. `build.mjs` fails loudly if they do.

### Deploying

```bash
node build.mjs && git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git push   # frontend
supabase functions deploy spotter --no-verify-jwt                  # backend
supabase db push                                                   # schema
```

## Extraction, and what it costs

Every save runs at most **one** AI call. The chain is OpenAI (GPT-5.6 Luna, if
`OPENAI_API_KEY` is set) → Anthropic → Gemini with model rotation → Groq. Underneath sits a keyless heuristic parser that
reads `3x10`-style lines, so a card is never empty even with every AI quota exhausted.

Per-user daily caps keep a public launch inside the free tiers: 10 new extractions and 40
total saves a day, overridable with `LIMIT_EXTRACT` / `LIMIT_SAVES`. Cache hits only count
against the second number, so saving videos other people already saved is effectively free.

### Platform notes

| Platform | Caption source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Instagram | og: tags via the `facebookexternalhit` UA, plus the `/embed/captioned/` page | Works. Carousel slides are read with vision only when the caption yields nothing. |
| TikTok | oEmbed | Often blocked from datacenter IPs; saves still work, with title and thumbnail only. |
| YouTube | oEmbed for title/author/thumb, Data API v3 for the description | The description **needs an API key**. Verified 2026-09: from a datacenter IP the watch page returns 429, the WEB player endpoint returns `LOGIN_REQUIRED`, ANDROID/iOS clients fail attestation, and both embedded-player clients error. Set `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` (or enable YouTube Data API v3 on the same Google project as `GEMINI_API_KEY`, which is used as a fallback). |
| Any web page | og: tags plus page text | Works. |

## Self-hosting

1. Create a Supabase project and `supabase link --project-ref <ref>`.
2. `supabase db push`.
3. Auth → Providers → Email on. Leave "Confirm email" **off** until you configure custom
   SMTP: the built-in mailer allows only a couple of messages an hour, which stalls signups.
4. Set the function secrets you want:
   `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, optionally `OPENAI_API_KEY` + `OPENAI_MODEL`
   (paid primary), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `CLAUDE_MODEL`, `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`,
   `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `LIMIT_EXTRACT`, `LIMIT_SAVES`. Or run `./set-keys.sh`.
5. `supabase functions deploy spotter --no-verify-jwt`.
6. Put your project URL and anon key at the top of `app.ts`, run `node build.mjs`, and
   serve `docs/` (GitHub Pages works: Settings → Pages → main branch, `/docs`).

## Saving from your phone

Settings in the app shows a personal save address containing your own key. Build a Shortcut:

1. **Receive** URLs from the share sheet
2. **Get Contents of URL** — your address, Method `POST`, Request Body JSON,
   one field `url` set to the Shortcut Input
3. **Show Result**

Share any reel to it and the workout is in your library before you put the phone down.
The key is not your password, but it can save to your account — rotate it in Settings if it
leaks.
